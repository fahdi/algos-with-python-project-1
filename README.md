## Assumptions

- Ignored constants
- Ignored any complexity that CSV reader has built in

## Task0 Analysis 

**O(1)**: Since the program only runs once irrespective of the number of input i.e. n , the worst case is o(1)

## Task1 Analysis 

**O(n)**: For each input it runs once so the Big Oh is O(n) 

## Task2 Analysis 

**O(n)**: Since the program only runs once, the worst case is o(n)


## Task3 Analysis 

**O(n)**: Since the program iterates over input twice, the worst case is o(2n) and a the Big Oh simply is O(n) and sort method is O(nlog(n)) so the program's Big Oh is O(nlog(n)) 

## Task4 Analysis 

**O(n)**: Since the program only iterates over all the inputs three times, the worst case is o(n) and sort adds O(nlog(n)) so for the program, it is O(nlog(n))
