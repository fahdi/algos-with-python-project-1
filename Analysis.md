#Analyses 

## Assumptions

- I have assumed no space complexity for built in python functions.
- Ignored constants
- Ignored any complexity that CSV reader has built in

## Task0 Analysis 

**O(1)**: Since the program only runs once irrespective of the number of input i.e. n , the worst case is o(1)

## Task1 Analysis 

**O(n)**: For each input it runs once so the Big Oh is O(n) 

## Task2 Analysis 

**O(n)**: Since the program only runs once, the worst case is o(n). max() is also O(n) so it will be O(2n) which can be simplified as O(n)


## Task3 Analysis 

**O(n)**: Since the program iterates over input twice, the worst case is o(2n) and a the Big Oh simply is O(n)

## Task4 Analysis 

**O(n)**: Since the program only iterates over all the inputs three times, the worst case is o(n)
